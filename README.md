X4 Foundations Proof-Of-Concept: voice-line changing

This is a POC mod that changes all the X4 v5.0 vanilla sector-name English voicelines to the Gawr Gura "A". This is to show that changing vanilla voice lines is possible through a mod.

The Gawr Gura "A" sound is obtained from:

The sound file is then edited to reduce its length, so that the famous "A" sound is played at the beginning of the sound file.

I do not claim ownership to Gawr Gura or their related brand names and etc. This is for illustrative purposes only. Fair use!
